# What if Grandma doesn’t want you to leave? 
# When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. 
# Change your previous program so that you have to shout 
# BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: 
# if you shout BYE three times but not in a row, you should 
# still be talking to Grandma.”
