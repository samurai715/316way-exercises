# Write a program that asks for a starting year and 
# an ending year and then puts all the leap years between 
# them (and including them, if they are also leap years). 

# Leap years are years divisible by 4 (like 1984 and 2004). However, 
# years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) 
# unless they are also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and 2000, 
# which were in fact leap years). What a mess!
