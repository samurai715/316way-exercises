# Write the program we talked about at the beginning 
# of this chapter, one that asks us to type as many words 
# as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just 
# press Enter on an empty line) and then repeats the 
# words back to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test 
# your program thoroughly; for example, does hitting Enter 
# on an empty line always exit your program? 
# Even on the first line? And the second? 
# Hint: There’s a lovely array method that will give you 
# a sorted version of an array: sort. Use it!”
