# Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns 
# its height and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages 
# the tree one year. Each year the tree grows taller (however much 
# you think an orange tree should grow in a year), and after some 
# number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. For the 
# first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while 
# it should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year 
# than younger trees…whatever you think makes the most sense. 
# And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges 
# (which returns the number of oranges on the tree) and 
# pick_an_orange (which reduces the @orange_count by 1 and returns 
# a string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else it 
# just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year). 
# Make sure any oranges you don’t pick one year fall off before 
# the next year.
