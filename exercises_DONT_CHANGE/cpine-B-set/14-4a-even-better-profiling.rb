# After you do your profiling, see the slow parts of your program, 
# and either make them faster or learn to love them as they are, 
# you probably don’t want to see all of that profiling anymore. 
# But (I hope) you’re too lazy to go back and delete it 
# all…especially because you might want to use it again someday. 
# Modify the profile method so you can turn all profiling on 
# and off by changing just one line of code. Just one word!
