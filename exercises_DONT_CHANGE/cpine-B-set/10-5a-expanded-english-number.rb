# This is preceded by an example for english number conversions. 
# First, put in thousands; it should return 'one thousand' 
# instead of (the sad) 'ten hundred' and 'ten thousand' 
# instead of 'one hundred hundred'.

# For example, put in millions so you get 'one million' instead 
# of 'one thousand thousand'. Then try adding billions, trillions, 
# and so on.
