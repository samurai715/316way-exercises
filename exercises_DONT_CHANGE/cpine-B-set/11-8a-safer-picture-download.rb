# Adapt the picture-downloading/file-renaming program to your 
# computer by adding some safety features to make sure you never 
# overwrite a file. A few methods you might find useful 
# are File.exist? (pass it a filename, and it will return 
# true or false) and exit (like if return and Napoleon 
# had a babyâ€”it kills your program right where it stands; 
# this is good for spitting out an error message and 
# then quitting).
