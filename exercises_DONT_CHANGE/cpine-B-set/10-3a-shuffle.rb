# Now that you’ve finished your new sorting algorithm, 
# how about the opposite? Write a shuffle method that takes 
# an array and returns a totally shuffled version. As always,

# How can you test to make sure you are getting a perfect 
# shuffle? What would you even say a perfect shuffle would be? 
# Now test for it.
