# How about wedding_number? It should work almost the same 
# as english_number, except it should insert the word and 
# all over the place, returning things like 
# 'nineteen hundred and seventy and two', or however wedding 
# invitations are supposed to look. I’d give you more examples, 
# but I don’t fully understand it myself. You might need to 
# contact a wedding coordinator to help you. 
# (I’m really just kidding. You don’t have to do this one. 
# I didn’t even do this one.)
